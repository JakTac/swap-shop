My Legacy

Jan 3rd -
Worked on the wireframe design

Jan 4th -
Had issues with docker for windows users
Modified docker compose and created our basic directories for our backend
Worked with SQL for the first time

Jan 5th -
Worked on backend getting a specific listing and a create function along with the paths to see in swagger.

Jan 6th -
Started authentication and using Melissas notes we managed to set up a lot of the basics for accounts

Jan 9th -
Jake studied up and was able to lead us on finishing our progress for backend auth. We also started delegating tasks on bens trello board.

Jan 10th -
We created a base on the front page to try out react cards. We struggled with trying to use an api for most of the day but it was shown to be hard and not really worth the effort since we can create listings ourselves.

Jan 11th -
We got login working which should be one of our hard pages so thats nice. Signup is also in progress.

Jan 12th -
This was a light day because of the google event but we worked on signup and had a simple spelling error destroy us for a while. At some point in the past few days i added a category table to the backend and had it insert default data so we can have the categories predetermined with no routes needed. On this day I expanded that to create a path to call those categories to populate a select drop down.

Jan 13th -
We got stuck on getting the navbar to update when the user is logged in.

Jan 17th -
The navbar took up the most of the day with the help of two instructors and seirs. In the end i solved it by tinkering with documentation and stuff online. I also helped fix a small mapping issue on Melissas Jewelry page.

Jan 18th -
I worked with Jake on the backend on creating a new path to get all listings for an account. Then i went to work on the mens page and got cards working for it. Melissa got the carousel working so ill try to set that up tomorrow.

Jan 19th -
I worked on my Mens page and helped Cody with his womens and create a listing form. The listing form had an issue with the auth. Then we switched to the update function with everyone so we can mark something as sold. Riley pointed us in the right direction and eventually we got it working.

Jan 20th -
Helped out on the profile page and added cards to Mens. It was just getting the buttons working on the profile/listings page and answering questions if i could.

Jan 23rd -
I continued to help out where was needed moving around and answering questions. I wasn't really needed much because my pages were done with the functionality.

Jan 24th -
I tried doing unit testing for create accounts but at the end of the day Riley told me not to do that one. So i switched to get listings and got it working within minutes.

Jan 25th -
I helped out everyone on testing a bit and helped touch up some code. This was a lot of minor mistakes that were  overlooked. I also had to catch up on journals, I do them in batches. We should have deployment next now that testing is done. Riley said we should hold off on deploying till tomorrow so we are.
