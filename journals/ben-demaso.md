BEN'S DAILY JOURNAL

Day 1 - January 4
    Today was all sorts of challenging, and we basically
    spent the entirety of group time troubleshooting Docker
    Windows issues. This was critical as 3/5 of our group is
    on PC's. Jake, Cody, and Melissa shared for most of the day.

Day 2 - January 5
    Similar to yesterday, we unfortunately had a lot of wasted
    calories on frustrating setup errors. However, by the end
    of the day we were finally making some headway, having a
    couple of routes to show for it. We comtinued programming as
    a full group of 5, with Alonso at the reigns for much of the
    day. He was a huge help with our forward progress, I was the
    coder for the rest of the day.

Day 3 - January 6
    Happy Friday! I hopped into screensharing and being the coder/typer
    with the rest of the group helping spot my typos and errors. We
    made really good progress on auth and Cody took over for the last
    hour or so of the day.

Day 4 - January 9
    After finishing the last routes in our backend and auth all together, it was time to fill out our kanban (Trello) board in Notion and divvy up responsibilities. We decided who would be responsible (main programmer) for each of 10 pages and who would be either pair or trio (we have 5 members) programming with them. We decided which pages would be more challenging forst, assigning them to a trio in lieu of a pair. Then, we discussed the dependency of the pages. Like tomorrow, we're starting with the API and filtering sdince every single page depends on those functionalities.

    This gives us an organized, concise plan of attack for the coming days that was well thought out based on difficulty and dependencies.

Day 5 - January 10
    Melissa crafted a "shared work" journal in this directory for us as we worked all together on the backend from Day 1 to Day 4. We would switch drivers, team code, and tap Riley and SEIRs for assistance when necessary. After building part of the Main Page, Nav, and API integration/filter function all together, we jumped into our pair and trio programming assignments. We built these initial front end/React pages together first as they were critical to the building of all other pages. No API integration means no products to show which means... blank webpages even if we did everything correctly.

    So that seemed like the natural place to start!

    Afterwards, we split up into our respective groups. Based on our order of importance (which page needed to be developed when), my first page was being Alonso's second pair of eyes on the Men's Page, and being primary programmer on the user Sale History Page. These pages however are later in our development timeline and Alonso was tied up being second for other pages, so I spent time reviewing Project Beta's functional components, and Candace's Redux and React Hooks lectures to allow me to more efficiently implement them when the time comes. I also looked ahead towards Websockets.

    Today's review focus was helpful and really increased my understanding. It was also a nice change of pace after a couple days of pushing hard through backend group work.

    So far it feels like we've been making great progress and are on track to finish this project in time without too much work outside of class time.
