First Day 1-3 making docker work (windows) was painful. After many days of trouble shooting window users was good to go by the 3rd day.

Jan 17th- We started off the day continuing off last week. Attempting to figure out a way for the nav bar to change when a user logs in/out the nav bar reflects that change showing different options. We can do it currently by refreshing the page but we are trying to make it an automatic change. Riley showed us a cool way to navigate with using {} for logout etc so we dont have to make a list with all of the token.js functions for ex [token,logout] etc
