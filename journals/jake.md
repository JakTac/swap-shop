Today, I worked on:

*Crud for authentication

Over the weekend I cleaned up the code in accounts removing the unfinished code from when we trying to get things to work. Today I added a fetch for all accounts function, a fetch for a single account based of of their ID, and I added the delete function. I also made it so the CUD of listings required you to be logged in before you could use said funcitons.

Rebuilding the project

Today we realized that we needed to have a group that the project was attached to. I created a group and linked the project to it. We later worked on authentication getting the create account to work as well as the login and logout.

* Rebuilding the project

After Riley posted his fix we tried implementing it. Unfortunately, that didn't work. I tried rebuilding the project and implementing the fix, which did work. I then went through the rest of the set up steps in this new project. Afterwards we went through and got this project to the same place that the previous project was at.

* Setting up the project

Today we started setting up the project. I started us off by following the set up direction on Learn. However, we ran into an issue on the Windows side. The react app wouldn't start. We have decided to work on the rest of the project and come back to it. Riley has tried to help us with the Windows fix and is currently looking for a solution
